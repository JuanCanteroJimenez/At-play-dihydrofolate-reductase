## Autoencoder in the study of dihydrofolate reductase

I have used a neural network with autoencoder architecture, as a non supervised aproach, with ResNet units composed of convulation layers. This had been used to process all the secuences with the highest review score in UniProt of the protein dihydrofolate reductase. The aim of this project is the study of the latented space of the net.
